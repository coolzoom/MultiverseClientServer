Multiverse Server README
------------------------

Things to note here.

The machine name needs to be set to your server name instead of localhost in the multiverse.properties
file it is called demonz1 so replace that with your machine name.

Make sure to edit the logging to fit your needs it is set to warn for now.

The logs will show missing files but they are not required to run the server and I left them in to allow the server to configure.
If the files are removed in the multiverse.py the server will not work.
